Teaching assistant problem


A university computer science department has a teaching assistant (TA) that holds office hours where they provide help to undergraduate students with their programming assignments. The TA's office is rather small, and only has room for one desk with a chair and a computer. There are three chairs outside the office where students may sit and wait if the TA is currently helping another student. If there are no available chairs in the waiting area, the student shows up at a later time. When the TA has finished helping a student, she goes outside to the waiting area to see if there are waiting students. If so, she takes the next student and begins to help them. If there are no waiting students, she returns to her chair in he office and takes a nap. If a student shows up and sees the TA sleeping, they sit in her chair and wake her up.
Using POSIX mutex locks and sempahores, design a solution to the sleeping TA problem.
